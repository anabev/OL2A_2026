Excluded Variables and Justifications

This document describes the variables that were excluded from the analysis and the corresponding reasons for their removal. Variables were excluded when they presented no variability across samples, contained only identifiers, or were not aligned with the objectives of the study.

BIOPSY_SITE  
Excluded because all samples correspond to breast tissue.

ETHNICITY  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Not Hispanic or Latino", with the exception of a single sample (A04N), resulting in insufficient variability for analysis.

ICD_10  
Excluded because all samples shared the same ICD-10 code (C50.9), corresponding to breast cancer.

OTHER_PATIENT_ID  
Excluded because this variable contains image-related identification codes and does not represent a clinical or biological characteristic.

PRIMARY_SITE_PATIENT  
Excluded because all samples originated from the breast.

PRIOR_MALIGNANCY  
Excluded because nearly all samples were classified as FALSE, with the exception of a single case (A1G4), providing insufficient variability.

PRIOR_TREATMENT  
Excluded because all samples were classified as FALSE.

SEX  
Excluded because all patients in the dataset are female.

PROJECT_ID  
Excluded because all samples belong to the same project ("TCGA-BRCA").

PROJECT_NAME  
Excluded because all samples were labeled as "Invasive Breast Carcinoma".

PROJECT_STATE  
Excluded because all samples had the same project state ("Released").

SAMPLE_ID  
Excluded because this variable represents a sample identifier and does not contain analytical information.

IS_FFPE  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "No".

OTHER_SAMPLE_ID  
Excluded because this variable represents alternative identification codes unrelated to the analytical objectives.

SAMPLE_TYPE  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Primary Tumor".

SAMPLE_TYPE_ID  
Excluded because all samples had the same identifier value ("1").

ONCOTREE_CODE  
Excluded because all samples shared the same OncoTree code ("BRCA").

CANCER_TYPE  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Invasive Breast Carcinoma".

CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Invasive Breast Carcinoma".

START_DATE.x  
Excluded because all values were recorded as zero.

STOP_DATE.x  
Excluded because all values were missing (NA).

EVENT_TYPE.x  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Diagnosis".

GRADE  
Excluded because all values were missing (NA).

EVENT_TYPE.y  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Treatment".

NUMBER_OF_CYCLES  
Excluded because all samples reported the same number of cycles (4).

THERAPEUTIC_AGENT  
Excluded by study design, as individual medications were intentionally not considered in the analysis.

TREATMENT_ANATOMIC_SITE  
Excluded because all values were missing (NA).

TREATMENT_EFFECT  
Excluded because all values were missing (NA).

TREATMENT_END_REASON  
Excluded because all values were missing (NA).

TREATMENT_OUTCOME  
Excluded because all samples were classified as "Complete Response".

TREATMENT_TYPE  
Excluded because most patients received more than one type of treatment. Instead, the variable "NUMBER_TREATMENT_TYPE" was created to represent the total number of different treatment modalities received by each patient.
